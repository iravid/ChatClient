Clients send and receive data as before. First message is the client name.

Server loop:
* while 1:
    * select() on { listen_fd, all_client_sockets }
    * foreach ready to read socket:
        * if it's the listen_fd, accept connection, save sockfd, read client name, acquire list mutex, add to the list and release
        * if it's a client socket:
            * copy to transmit buffer
            * signal transmit condition
            * wait on transmitted condition
            * acquire draw mutex, draw, release
            
* Transmit thread:
    * while 1:
        * wait on transmit condition
        * acquire socket list mutex, transmit on all sockets, release
        * signal the transmitted condition
